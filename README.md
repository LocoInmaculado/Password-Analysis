# Password analysis
Analysis of your password to show an estimated time in which it would be cracked in the event that someone malicious tried it. Based on a publication by Hive systems.
This publication consists of a table in which they appear in five columns, depending on how it is created the password and its length, the time it would take to be forced. I have used the table for the year 2023.

The symbols, characters and numbers contemplated in this version are:

"ª" "º" "#" "$" "!" "%" "€" "%" "~" "&" "/" "(" ")" "=" "." "," ":" ";" "{" "}" "ç" "<" ">" "|" " " 
"+" "-" "[" "]" "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N" "Ñ" "O" "P" "Q" "R" "S" "T" "U" "V" "W" "X" "Y" "Z" "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" "ñ" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "9" "0"

Feel free to add or remove any you don't need. You can do this by editing the script and altering the corresponding lists.

Remember, use passwords formed with uppercase and lowercase letters, add numbers and symbols. Change them regularly and never use the same password for different sites.
